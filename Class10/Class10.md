> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, the winpercent.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

True or False. zero means not chocolate and one means chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](Class10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

``` r

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

What is the best (most loked in terms of `winpercent`) for the money (in
teerms of `pricepercent`)?

To answer this I will make a plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

``` r
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=2, max.overlaps = 5)
```

    Warning: ggrepel: 27 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
    increasing max.overlaps

  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +

## 5 Exploring the correlation structure

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.92 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are anti-correlated.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent are most positively correlated.

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the

Fruity, hard and pluribus. Yes, it make sense. The candies belongs to
these these three category are pushed to positive x-axis of the PC1. The
result is consistent with the above corrplot.
